## Analyzing COVID-19 Mortality Trends and Conditions in the Midwest
## Introduction
The Midwest region has encountered significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, with diverse impacts across states, demographics, and pre-existing health conditions. Analyzing mortality trends, demographic patterns, and the underlying health conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths can yield critical insights into the factors influencing fatality rates. By utilizing comprehensive data on deaths, health conditions, and demographics, this study aims to uncover trends and correlations that enhance our understanding of the pandemic's effects on specific regions and populations.
This analysis emphasizes key metrics, such as total COVID-19 deaths by state, the distribution of deaths by age group, and the relationship between health conditions and mortality rates. Through the use of visualizations and statistical analyses, it seeks to identify high-impact conditions, vulnerable age groups, and demographic patterns that have shaped COVID-19 outcomes in the Midwest.
## Research Question:
What are the trends, demographic distributions, and condition-specific factors influencing COVID-19 deaths across Midwest states?
## Objective:
* Visualize total COVID-19 deaths across Midwest states to identify regional disparities.
* Explore demographic patterns by analyzing the distribution of deaths by age group using boxplots.
* Analyze temporal trends in COVID-19 deaths over time using line plots.
* Investigate the impact of conditions by creating bar plots to rank conditions contributing to mortality.
* Perform correlation analysis to assess relationships between COVID-19 deaths and other numeric metrics, such as the number of mentions.
#### Identify key insights:
* Determine the age group and condition with the highest number of deaths.
* Rank conditions by their impact on specific states or demographic groups.

## Insights from the Analysis:
* Visualizing COVID-19 deaths by state highlights variations in mortality rates across Midwest states, indicating differences in healthcare access, public health policies, or population density.
* Boxplot analysis of deaths by age group reveals that older age groups (e.g., 55+) have significantly higher mortality rates, emphasizing the pandemic's disproportionate impact on the elderly.
* Line plots of COVID-19 deaths over time show peaks corresponding to pandemic waves. Smoothing the data with rolling averages reveals long-term patterns and trends in mortality.
* Bar plots of deaths by conditions, such as respiratory diseases and cardiovascular issues, rank these conditions' impact, identifying key health factors contributing to COVID-19 fatalities.
* Correlation analysis shows significant relationships between the number of COVID-19 deaths and the "Number of Mentions" column, suggesting consistency in reporting or documentation.
* High-Impact Demographics and Conditions:
The age group 55â€“64, combined with respiratory diseases like influenza and pneumonia, emerges as the most affected category.
Conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are also notable contributors to mortality in specific states.
* Policy Implications: Insights from condition-specific and demographic patterns can guide targeted interventions, such as prioritizing vaccination and healthcare resources for vulnerable groups and regions.
